# Lowbro - Lowprofile planck
## Introduction

I wanted to test choc switches so I needed a new keyboard. 
I was using my own designed [Skyline](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fi2qxug5wl37d1.jpeg) (the split one in the front) for quite some time, but needed a change. So I decided to dust of my planck and go for it again.

I decided that I don't want to buy new parts(except the switches and keycaps ofcourse), but print them myself at home. 
So I bought the switches and keycaps and designed a new case and plate for my usecase. There are existing ones, but I printed one and it was to brittle for my taste.

## Printing
The case and plate can be printed without any supports. I had to split the both halves, because my printing bed was too small for the whole case. But if you have a bigger printing bed, I have added an stl for a unicase.
It could be that you have to cut a little bit from the plates and cases when you try to glue them together, depends on your printer settings.

## Firm- and Hardware
I use a [Nice Nano v2](https://nicekeyboards.com/nice-nano/) so i can go wireless if I desire so.
This means that I use zmk instead of qmk. Luckily [zmk.studio](zmk.studio) got released as a public beta, so we can change our keymaps on the fly. 
So if you don't care for my planck, atleast you can see how to configure everything, so the firmware will be created in an github action and you can use zmk.studio.
I had some problems understanding the documentation (I'm dumb), but this repo could serve as an example how to do it.

Have fun with the board and feel free to reach out to me on my [discord server](https://discord.gg/3rkTHrdh) if you need help regarding the soldering or have any questions or interest in other unique, self designed boards :)
